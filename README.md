## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the latest ```subtool``` release with the Node Package Manager by running:  

    sudo npm install -g https://github.com/subtub/subtool/tarball/master

To install a specific version run:

    sudo npm install -g https://github.com/subtub/subtool/archive/v0.0.1.tar.gz

    sudo npm uninstall -g subtool
    
### The .subfile

If you want to generate ```README.md``` files with the subtool, it need an ```.subfile``` to configure the generator.

A ```.subfile``` looks like:  

    // subtool configuration file
    // version 0.0.1
    module.exports = {
    
      //Settings for the README.md file.
      readme: {
        content: '/docs',
        toc: true,
        order: [
          {title: 'Foo', file: '/foo.md'},
          {title: 'Bar', file: '/bar.md'},
          {title: 'Baz', file: '/baz.md'}
        ]
      },
      
      // License settings.
      license: 'mit',
      
    }

## The .subfile  

If you want to generate ```README.md``` files with the subtool, you need a ```.subfile``` to configure the generator.

A ```.subfile``` looks like:  

```
// subtool configuration file
module.exports = { version: '0.0.4',

  // Set GitHub User- and Project-Name.
  github: {
    username: 'NAME',
    project: 'PROJECT'
  },

  // Settings for the README.md file.
  readme: {
    // Generate a Table of Content Markdown list.
    toc: true,
    content: [
      { title: 'General Information',  file: '/docs/general_information.md' }
    ]
  },
  
  // Set the type of License you want to use. Choose between the following types:
  // apache, freebsd, isc, mit, newbsd
  license: 'mit',

  // If true, generate a CONTRIBUTING.md file.
  contributing: true,
  
  // If true, 
  travis: {
    language: 'node_js',
    version: ['0.4', '0.6', '0.8', '0.10']
  }
}
