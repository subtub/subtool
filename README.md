## The .subfile  

If you want to generate ```README.md``` files with the subtool, it need an ```.subfile``` to configure the generator.

A ```.subfile``` looks like:  

```
// subtool configuration file
module.exports = { version: '0.0.1',

  // Set GitHub User- and Project-Name.
  github: {
    username: 'NAME',
    project: 'PROJECT'
  },

  // Settings for the README.md file.
  readme: {
    // Generate a Table of Content Markdown list.
    toc: true,
    content: [
      { title: 'General Information',  file: '/docs/general_information.md' }
    ]
  },
  
  // Set the type of License we want to use. Choose between the following types:
  // apache, freebsd, isc, mit, newbsd
  license: 'mit',

  // If true, generate a CONTRIBUTING.md file.
  contributing: true,
  
  // If true, 
  travis: {
    language: 'node_js',
    version: ['0.4', '0.6', '0.8', '0.10']
  }
}
